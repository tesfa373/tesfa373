3.I’ve always been curious about how technology works behind the scenes. I started learning software engineering to gain the ability to solve real-world problems through code, build things from scratch, and contribute to innovative solutions that improve people’s lives. Joining the ALX program gave me the opportunity to explore this path with structure and community support.


4.I’m inspired by the impact software can have on people’s daily lives — from automation to accessibility. Seeing how developers solve complex problems motivates me to keep learning. I’m also driven by continuous improvement and the excitement of creating something functional and useful from just an idea.


5.My long-term goal is to become a skilled full-stack developer who builds scalable, secure, and user-friendly web applications. I also want to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with global teams solving meaningful challenges, especially in education, health, and finance.
6. TI enjoy working on backend systems, APIs, and full-stack applications that solve practical problems. I’m particularly interested in building tools for productivity, learning platforms, and data-driven apps. I also love projects that help me understand system architecture and performance.
