## 🚀 About Me

I’ve always been curious about how technology works behind the scenes. That curiosity led me to software engineering — where I could turn ideas into real, working solutions. I began this journey to gain the skills to solve real-world problems, build things from the ground up, and contribute to meaningful innovations that improve people’s lives.

Thanks to the ALX Software Engineering program, I’ve had the opportunity to dive deep into full-stack development, grow within a global learning community, and gain real-world, project-based experience.
